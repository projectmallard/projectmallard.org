  <title>Examples</title>

  <p>Comment-out a single line:</p>

  <example><code mime="text/x-ducktype"><![CDATA[
This is some text in a paragraph.
[-] This line is commented out and is not parsed.
This is part of the paragraph again.
]]></code></example>

  <p>Comment out a group of lines:</p>

  <example><code mime="text/x-ducktype"><![CDATA[
This is some text in a paragraph.
[--
This line is commented out and is not parsed.
This line is also part of the comment.
--]
This is part of the paragraph again.
]]></code></example>

  <p>Block comments cannot be nested, but you can have line comments in
  block comments:</p>

  <example><code mime="text/x-ducktype"><![CDATA[
This is some text in a paragraph.
[--
This line is commented out and is not parsed.
[-] This line comment inside the block comment is OK.
--]
This is part of the paragraph again.
]]></code></example>

<!-- BEGIN spec -->
<section id="spec">
  <title>Specification</title>

  <p>A line comment is any line that starts with <code>[-]</code>, possibly
  with leading whitespace. The entire line is not parsed.</p>

  <p>A block comment starts with a line that starts with <code>[--</code>,
  possibly with leading whitespace. It ends with a line that contains only
  <code>--]</code>, possibly with leading and trailing whitespace. All lines
  within a block comment are not parsed.</p>

  <p>Comment syntax takes priority over all other syntax, including
  <link xref="duck_fence">fences</link>. The leading indentation of comments
  has no effect on the block nesting of the content around them.</p>

  <p>Parsers may or may not pass comments through to XML or other exported
  formats.</p>
