<title>Internationalization Notes</title>

<p>This page provides details for people creating translation tools and
other internationalization systems that support Mallard documents. Mallard
is an XML format, so there is a wealth of translation tools and techniques
that can be applied. XML does not immediately solve all problems, however,
and Mallard was designed from the beginning to support features that are
important to proper document localization.</p>

<section id="message">
  <title>Message-based Translation</title>

  <p>One of the most difficult aspects of document translation is tracking
  changes to the source document. For this reason, message-based translation
  systems such as PO files or XLIFF are popular. XML formats lend themselves
  well to message-based translation systems, but developers must decide what
  type of content constitutes a message.</p>

  <p>In Mallard, block and inline content are always distinct. You can never,
  for example, place a paragraph inside the text content of another paragraph.
  This was done in large part to avoid the need for placeholders in messages.
  Some elements, such as <code>code</code> and <code>media</code>, can occur
  in either a block or an inline context. When processing a Mallard page, it
  is important to keep track of context so you know how to treat an element.</p>

  <p>Mallard never places translatable text in attribute values.</p>
</section>

<section id="attributes">
  <title>Internationalization Attributes</title>

  <p>Mallard does not contain its own elements to specify language or text
  directionality. To specify language, use the standard <code>xml:lang</code>
  attribute. To override text directionality, use the
  <code href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its/#directionality">its:dir</code>
  attribute from the <link href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its/">W3C
  Internationalization Tag Set</link> (ITS).</p>

  <p>It is strongly recommended that you support ITS in translation tools.
  For example, to allow authors to mark certain elements as non-translatable,
  use the
  <code href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its/#trans-datacat">its:translate</code>
  attribute.</p>
</section>

<section id="link">
  <title>Link Text</title>

  <p>Mallard can automatically generate text for a link using the title
  of the target page or section. In many formats, this presents a serious
  problem to languages with declensions for different parts of speech.</p>

  <p>Mallard allows any number of extra <link xref="mal_info_title#link">link
  titles</link> to be provided for a page or section. Each of these link titles
  specifies where it should be used with the <code>role</code> attribute. Links
  can then specify which title to use using the <code>role</code> attribute on
  the <code xref="mal_inline_link">link</code> element.</p>

  <p>You should provide a way for translators to provide additional link titles
  for each page or section, and for them to specify the appropriate roles on
  inline links.</p>
</section>

<section id="media">
  <title>Media Elements</title>

  <p>Mallard allows audio, video, and images to be inserted into pages using
  the <code>media</code> element. These cannot generally be translated using
  textual translation tools. You should provide a way for translators to
  provide localized multimedia files and see when the original files have
  changed.</p>
</section>

<section id="credits">
  <title>Translation Credits</title>

  <p>Mallard allows contributors to be credited using the
  <code xref="mal_info_credit">credit</code> element. The <code>type</code>
  attribute can be set to <code>"translator"</code> to credit translators.
  Since translator credits aren't direct translations of existing elements,
  they can't be provided using simple message-based translation alone.</p>

  <p>You should provide a mechanism to insert translator credits into
  translated output pages.</p>
